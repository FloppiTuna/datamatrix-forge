# Compact Disc

The Compact Disc (CD) is one of the most common forms of optical storage media. It is most commonly used for the storage of audio.
It is widely recognized by its circular form.

Each CD can contain up to 40 MB of data, and can be used in a [CD Player]("./cd_player.md").

Be careful, though; every byte written to any given offset is there **forever!** Be careful when burning your playlists!

## Usage

### DMCDs (Audio CDs)
If you have CC: Tweaked installed, you can connect a CD Player to your computer (using a Wired Modem) to burn your own audio CDs!
